These were the original layouts I was trying before deciding to build a new outfeed tray. I will start to layout physical items and get a picture in my head of how it will work. I will clamp scap pieces together and make pieces out of cardboard. In this particular instance, nothing worked. It all looked too cheesy. So I started over.

My main issue was I was trying to apply precision to a non-precision slide. The original stop used a pipe and a screw clamp. It worked no matter how many chips or how much coolant got on it. It works in a very dirty spot so wanted to keep the same robustness. I wanted to tighten it up some and make it easy to connect to the DRO.

I decided to go with a piece of Unistrut for the slide mechanism.

I played around with springs for the coupling mechanism to eliminate backlash, but ended up with a press fit between a stainless steel shaft and a delrin fork. This allows the pin to slide in and out, and up and down. The delrin applies enough pre-load to eliminate any backlash. If I did this again, I would just use a dowel pin for the shaft.
