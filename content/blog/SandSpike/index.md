I was going crab fishing for the second time! The first time I went I had to use rocks to prop my pole up. And of course, I forgot to buy a sand spike. So I made one...

Typical of many projects, the first thing I did was lay out some material to get an idea of what would work. I was originally going to make it from some old pvc pipe, but the indide diameter was pretty small.

I welded the basket on.

I welded some ears on made from angle and sprayed it with Plasti Dip. And that was pretty much it!
